## Suggestions
It may be worth your while to install the [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager
) for Notepad++ and the following plugins to crank up the UX (user experience) a few notches. These names can be found in the Plugin Manager's index once it is installed, rather than visiting the linked websites.

* [CodeAlignment](http://codealignment.com/ForNotepadPlusPlus.html)
* [Elastic Tabstops](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/)
* [Compare (two files)](https://github.com/jsleroy/compare-plugin)
* [TopMost](https://sites.google.com/site/fstellari/nppplugins)
* [Lua Script](https://github.com/dail8859/LuaScript) (for RPM to MAS prop converting)
